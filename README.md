# Hyper-pummel
A game made with a controller browser API. This game requires a controller to work.

# Instructions
You plug in your controller, click ready, wait for the countdown, and start mashing when it's ready.

# Game modes

## Solo mode
Solo mode is the first game mode, where you strive for the top! You select a controller (keyboard or game controller) and spam after pressing ready. Your Clicks Per Second score will be calculated after 10 seconds, and saved. Then your score will appear in the leaderboard.

## Duo mode
Duo mode is the PvP gamemode. One player plugs in a controller, the other player goes with the keyboard. Once ready, you will both start mashing. The one who punches away all the balls wins!

## Duo controller mode (DUOC mode)
DUOC mode is like PvP, except both players use a controller instead of one player having to use a keyboard.
